# Fitget-Spinner-
A fun project that I was challenged by a peer to make!

This project uses the pygame library. In order to run this program successfully,
please insure you have this library downloaded.

To dowload pygame, type: pip install pygame 
into your python terminal

The spinner is controlled using the left and right arrow keys.

Happy spinning!
